**PCA Dimensionality Reduction on Seeds Dataset**

**Overview**

This project demonstrates how to apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction using the Seeds dataset. PCA is a technique used to reduce the number of features while preserving the most significant variance in the data. This tutorial provides step-by-step code to standardize the dataset, apply PCA, and visualize the results.

**Features**

Step-by-step implementation of PCA:

* Standardization: Preprocessing data to ensure equal weighting for all features.

* Covariance Matrix Calculation: Capturing relationships between features.

* Eigen Decomposition: Determining principal components.

* Dimensionality Reduction: Transforming data to a reduced space while retaining maximum variance.

* Visualization: Comparing original data with PCA-transformed data.

* Advanced PCA:
  Bootstrapping for robust variance estimation.
  Confidence intervals for variance explained by components.

**Requirements**

You can run this project directly in a Google Colab notebook. The following Python libraries are used in the code:
* Libraries
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
  * scikit-learn
  * ipywidgets (for interactive visualizations)
    
**Project Structure**

The project consists of a Google Colab notebook:

├── PCA.ipynb    # Google Colab notebook to apply PCA on the Seeds dataset
└── README.md                  # Documentation for this project

**How to Use the Code**

* Step 1: Open the Google Colab Notebook
  Open the Google Colab notebook directly by clicking on the link below (or copy-paste it into your browser):

  In the Colab notebook, you will find the full code for PCA implementation.

* Step 2: Load and Run the Notebook
  Once you've opened the notebook, you can follow these steps to run the code:

  Run the Notebook Cells: The code is divided into cells, and you can run each one sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter for each cell. Each cell will load data, preprocess it, apply PCA, and show 
  visualizations.

  Explore the Visualizations: The notebook provides scatter plots to visualize the original data (Area vs. Perimeter), the PCA-transformed data (Principal Component 1 vs. Principal Component 2), and the 
  explained variance of each principal component.

  Interactive Widget: An interactive widget allows you to adjust the number of principal components and visualize how the variance explained changes dynamically.

* Step 3: View the Results
  Original Data Visualization: A scatter plot comparing the first two features (Area and Perimeter).
  
  PCA Visualization: A scatter plot comparing the first two principal components.
  
  Variance Explained Plot: A bar and line graph showing how much variance each principal component explains.

**Code Explanation**

1. Standardization:
   The dataset is standardized using StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing. This ensures that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is crucial for PCA.

3. PCA Application:
   The PCA transformation is performed with PCA(n_components=2) from sklearn.decomposition. This reduces the dataset to two principal components.
The explained variance ratio for each component is displayed, helping to understand how much variance is captured by each principal component.

5. Visualization:
   
The code generates two scatter plots:
One showing the original data using the first two features (Area and Perimeter).
The other showing the transformed data in terms of the first two principal components.
A bar plot and cumulative variance line graph illustrate how much variance is explained by each principal component.

7. Interactive Widget:
An interactive widget, powered by ipywidgets, allows users to dynamically explore the effect of varying the number of principal components on the cumulative variance explained.
